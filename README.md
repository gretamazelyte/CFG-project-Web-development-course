# CFG-project Introduction to web development course project webpage

This was a fun CFG project which consisted of producing a webpage. The result can be viewed here: https://gretamazelyte.github.io/CFG-project-Web-development-course/

There are 5 pages in total.

While creating this webpage, we tried following features:

- HTML and CSS coding for structure and style;
- Bootstrap code library to create a navbar;
- Simple Javascript 'mousein' and 'mouseout' hover events with pictures.

This was a team project and I would like to thank my team members for wonderful work together!

There are several files of code within this project:

Index file - a base title page HTML code with linking to other webpages.
CSS folder - it contains main.css file which is the main styling sheet for all of the pages.
JS folder - it contains app.js file that has the main JavaScript functions used to change images using hover events.
Image folder - it contains all the images used in this webpage.
Pages folder - it contains URLs for title page.
